<h2>Low and Slow</h2>

<p><em>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</em></p>

<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide.</em> In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <em>Cooking for Greeks,</em> Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching."</p>

<h2>Cooking With Daniel</h2>

<p><em>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</em></p>

<p>This week I'd like to share my experience spending a crisp, Spring day in Portsmouth, NH cooking and chatting with Daniel Lorca of the band Nada Surf as he prepared a gourmet, sit-down dinner for 28 pals. <a href="read here.html">Read Here</a></p>

<p><center>Next month, we will be serving <b><em>Sous Vide</em> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. <br>To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</center></p>
